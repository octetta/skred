This `tclkit.exe` came from a legend in the Tcl community named Roy Keene.

All credit to him and the Tcl/Tk community for making excellent tools for messing around.

To re-create visit:

https://kitcreator.rkeene.org/kitcreator

And set the following values:

- KitCreator Version 0.12.2
- Tcl Version 8.6.12
- Platform Windows/amd64
- Packages Metakit, Tk, TclUDP

For me, this generated the url and description:

- URL: https://kitcreator.rkeene.org/kits/92419e4a7177f50c8b9c0baf792438fc09ee0397/tclkit.exe
- Description: Tcl 8.6.12, KitCreator 0.12.2, Platform win64, Unthreaded, Packages: mk4tcl, tk, udp

THIS IS A HACK AT BEST NOW!!!

Run from Linux via "wine tclkit.exe fire" --- fire is hacked from source above and needs work for alignement...
